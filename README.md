# The Perfect Fit

This project examines possible variables that might affect the desirability of a living in a state,
including variables such as climate, population density, and median home value. This allows a user to
find the most affordable area to live in while simultaneously satisfying their personal preferences of what
type of environment they value.

With this program you are able to customize the parameters of multiple factors, and immediately see a map
of the results that match your selections. This program uses `R` and `shiny` in order to make an easy to use
and highly beneficial tool for people that are looking for states with certain attributes. The data being used
is taken from multiple sources that have different information about each state in the United States. These
factors include Political Affiliation, Average Temperature, Density, Cost of Living, Median Home Income,
and School Rank. The user is able to select ranges and weights for each one in order to find the best state for
them.
